    "text": "I am an interdisciplinary social and environmental psychologist whose work examines individual and collective responses to the climate and nature crisis. My research focuses on how identities, moral commitments, and social norms shape engagement with climate action, including participation in activism, responses to protest, and the way scientific communities and institutions position themselves in relation to the climate crisis. I am trained in anthropology (BA, MA), cognitive science (MSc), and social psychology (PhD), and have published high-quality research using a wide range of qualitative and quantitative methods, including surveys, interviews, focus groups, and ethnography.\nMy work spans three intersecting domains. First, I study science, communication, and society, with a particular focus on scientist climate advocacy, activism, and questions of credibility and public trust. Second, I examine collective climate action from two perspectives: 1) from the perspective of those engaged in collective action and 2) examining public responses to climate protest and civil disobedience. Third, I investigate institutional climate responses and leadership. My current work at Lancaster University, supported by the Wellcome Trust, explores the ethical and cultural dimensions of sustainability in UK higher education, including how universities conceptualise their responsibilities in addressing the climate crisis.\nI have held senior research roles at both the University of Bristol, where I worked across the Schools of Psychology and Policy Studies researching public attitudes to disruptive climate protest, and at Lancaster University, where I am based in the Social Processes Group within the Department of Psychology conducting research on scientist advocacy and activism, research culture, and universities’ climate responses. These positions have allowed me to combine interdisciplinary research, applied policy engagement, and collaborative projects with academic and non-academic partners.\nYou can find:\n\nMy academic work under Publications\nMy teaching under Teaching\nLonger-form writing, blogging, and commentary under Writing & Commentary\nInvited talks and media under Talks & Media\nA summary of how I approach research under My Research Approach\n\n\n\n GitHub\n LinkedIn\n Bluesky\n University profile"

The content you curated goes to the heart of many of the ethical and philosophical reasons for choosing the course I think. I think any of the people on the course are there because they are bravely trying to confront the eco-anxiety they are carrying which is the climate elephant in the room really - they are vulnerable precisely BECAUSE they are facing into these most difficult topics. To understand that they are joining a global conversation led by mature and wise researchers who also battle with this stuff is, in many ways, deeply reassuring - one great antidote to anxiety is to know you are not alone, another is to deploy your own agency. The way you structured the course provided enough provocative content, that you held safely, coupled with individual reflection time, which can be helpful for anyone feeling overwhelmed. So, great course, offering more than just module learning but also potentially an embedded act of well being recognising the enormity of the subject in hand.”\nFeedback on SGA420 Navigating Sustainability and Global Environmental Futures."

    "section": "Research Approach",
    "text": "Research Approach\nMy research approach is grounded in methodological pluralism, with different methods used to address distinct analytic questions within a coherent theoretical programme. Rather than treating methods as interchangeable tools, I use qualitative and quantitative approaches in a complementary and sequential way.\nEthnography and in-depth qualitative interviews allow me to examine how identities, norms, and moral commitments are enacted and negotiated in situ, particularly in high-stakes contexts of collective action and environmental mobilisation. This includes close attention to interactional dynamics, how processes unfold over time, and the practical dilemmas actors face as they navigate competing expectations.\nQuantitative and experimental methods are then used to test, refine, and generalise insights generated through qualitative work. In my PhD and subsequent projects, ethnographic findings directly informed the design of surveys and interviews, ensuring that psychological measures were grounded in the lived realities of the groups under study.\nThis approach reflects a view of social psychological theory as something that should be generated from, and remain accountable to, real-world social processes. Drawing on anthropological sensibilities, I attend closely to context, practice, and meaning-making; and from social psychology, I draw on established theories of identity, norms, and collective action."

    "text": "Theoretical Contribution\nMy work makes a theoretical contribution to social identity approaches to collective action by foregrounding the role of identity content and intra-identity fit in shaping engagement in pro-environmental and collective action. Building on social identity theory and related models, I examine how individuals navigate situations in which multiple salient identities are not simply additive but may be experienced as ideologically or normatively misaligned.\nThis is particularly evident in cases where professional and moral commitments come into tension, such as scientists engaging in climate advocacy or activism. Commitments associated with the scientist identity, including objectivity and neutrality can come into tension with activist orientations that emphasise moral urgency, disruption, and value advocacy.\nThrough sustained ethnographic engagement and in-depth interviews, I show how these tensions are actively negotiated in practice and how this negotiation shapes participation, persistence, and forms of action. This contributes a more processual account of collective action that foregrounds identity content, identity compatibility, and ongoing identity work over time."

    "text": "Contributions of my work\nThe primary contribution of this work is situated within social and environmental psychology, particularly theories of social identity, collective action, and pro-social behaviour. By focusing on identity content, identity negotiation, and the processes by which people come to engage in pro-environmental behaviours in real-world contexts, the research advances psychological understanding of why high levels of concern and identification do not always translate straightforwardly into action, and why engagement can take divergent forms, including escalation, withdrawal, or sustained commitment. In doing so, it offers a framework for understanding action and inaction among highly concerned actors embedded in professional and institutional roles.\nBeyond psychology he work makes distinct contributions to several adjacent fields. In communication science, it provides empirically grounded insight into how credibility, authority, and moral positioning are managed by expert communicators, showing how scientists’ communicative choices are shaped by identity concerns in addition to message strategy. In Science and Technology Studies, the research offers a fine-grained account of boundary work as a lived, interactional process, documenting how epistemic and advocacy roles are negotiated in practice rather than assumed as fixed categories. In philosophy of science, the findings inform debates about the norms of scientific conduct by empirically examining how values such as objectivity, restraint, and responsibility are interpreted and enacted under conditions of moral urgency given the climate crisis."
